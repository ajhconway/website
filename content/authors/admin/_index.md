I am a researcher at VMware Research Group, where my principle area of research
is the intersection of external memory theory and storage systems. I am
especially interested in key-value stores, file systems, filters and other
systems built on a strong theoretical foundation.

My recent publications include work on [key-value stores for fast
storage](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc20-conway.pdf), [file system
aging](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/pubs/fast17.pdf), [external memory hash
tables](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/9043/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2018-39.pdf)
and [the analysis of storage optimization
heuristics](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611975482.155).

I am the lead of the SplinterDB project. SplinterDB is a general purpose
key-value store built using a new data structure, the size-tiered
$B^\varepsilon$-tree. SplinterDB is designed for outstanding performance on
NVMe and other fast storage hardware, under tough conditions, such as strict memory
limits, small key-value pairs and limits on CPU utilization.

I am a member of the BetrFS team, which built and maintains the BetrFS
prototype file system. BetrFS is designed around the principles of
write-optimization, and is built using variants of $B^\varepsilon$-trees.
